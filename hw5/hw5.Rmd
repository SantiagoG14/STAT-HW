## Question 1:

```{r}
# p(x < 80) 
pnorm(80, 72.6, 4.78)

# p(60 < x < 80)
pnorm(80, 72.6, 4.78) - pnorm(60, 72.6, 4.78)

# c
qnorm(0.95, 72.6, 4.78)

# p(x > 70)
1 - pnorm(70, 72.6, 4.78)

```

a. p(x < 80) = 0.939203 = 93.9%
b. p(60 < x < 80) = p(x < 80) - p(x < 60) = 0.9350083 = 93%
c. 80.46 miles per hour
d. p(x > 70) = 1 - p(x < 70) =  0.7067562 = 70.6%

## Question 2:

a. computer chips at a factory
b. the rate of chips with severe defects
c. 27/212 = 0.1273585 = 12.7%
d. margin of error or standard error
e. 
$Z^* = Z\frac{alpha}{2}$
$= Z0.05/2$
$= z0.05$
$= -1.64$

$SE = Z^*\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}$
$= -1.64\sqrt{\frac{0.1273(1 - 0.12735)}{212}}$
$\pm0.0375$

f. no because this is between the confidence interval 
g. new value would be $\pm0.0337$, the results don't change that much, since the margin of error only decreased 0.0037

## Question 3:

a. 
b. I would expect it to be 

## Question 4: 

a. False, when using a confidence interval, we need to generalize the results to the entire population, not just to the sample

b. True, this answer generalizes the confidence interval to the entire population

c. True, because the sample would be from the population, thus it would be between our confidence interval 

d. False,
